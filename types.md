# Types
Examples and  notes on JS Types

## Primitive Types

JavaScript defines six primitive types:

* `null`
* `undefined`
* `boolean`
* `number`
* `string`
* `symbol` -- ES6 only!

**Note:** All of these are built-in types except `object` are called "primitives".

## The Non-Primitive Object Type
* `object`

**Note:** So there are seven built-in types altogether
